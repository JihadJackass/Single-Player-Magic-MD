 spm_news.2.t: "The Cartel Wars End - El Chapo’s Final Victory"
 spm_news.2.d: "For decades, rival narco groups carved bloody scars across the Americas, fighting for scraps of empire and fleeting dominance. But with the rise of the CJNG under the iron grip of El Chapo, the chaos has ended.\n\nAcross half of America, Cascadia, Central America, and the vast territories of the Gran Columbian Narco Republics and Narco Patagonia, the banners of lesser cartels have been torn down. Their leaders were given a choice: swear absolute loyalty to the CJNG or vanish into the shadows of history. Some surrendered and pledged allegiance, while others were quietly eliminated in the night, their empires swallowed whole by the relentless tide of CJNG power.\n\nThe Panama Canal, now firmly under CJNG control, has become both a symbol and a weapon of this authority—an artery of global commerce redirected to flow through cartel hands. From the bustling ports of the Pacific to the trade hubs of the Atlantic, merchants, corporations, and even governments find themselves forced to deal on CJNG’s terms. Even in Africa, where CJNG forces clash with Mali, whispers spread of a new narco order stretching far beyond its birthplace, a transoceanic dominion that no rival can ignore.\n\nWhat was once a fractured underworld has been forged into a single empire, bound by fear, profit, and the will of El Chapo Guzmán. No longer just a cartel, the CJNG now stands as the undisputed power of the hemisphere—its influence spanning continents, its enemies crushed, and its ambitions unchecked. The era of competing narco groups has ended; the era of the CJNG has begun."

 # Hawaii

 spm_news.16.t: "Grand Admiral Robert McKawth Takes Control of the Japanese Naval Mission in the Pacific Shield"
 spm_news.16.d: "After weeks of brutal naval skirmishes and clandestine negotiations, the islands of Hawaii have finally fallen. Yet, rather than a clean victory for the Shinsei Shōri Shogunate, a shadow loomed from the other side of the Pacific. The Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), seeking to secure trafficking routes and economic influence in the Pacific, openly challenged Japan’s hold.\n\nTensions escalated to the brink of conflict, but neither side wished to drain resources in an open war. A pact was forged: the Shogunate would retain formal claims to Hawaii as a crown possession of the new order, while the CJNG secured lucrative economic rights and political channels in return. Though an uneasy compromise, the deal ensures stability—at least for now.\n\nStill, many within the Shogunate cry betrayal, while others applaud the pragmatic diplomacy that preserves strength for the greater conquest of Asia. The court must decide how this “Pacific Compromise” will be remembered."
